This repository demonstrates a subtle error in a COBOL PERFORM VARYING loop. The provided COBOL code contains an error in its loop termination condition. The intended behavior is for the loop to execute 10 times; however, an error in the condition results in either an infinite loop or the loop terminating prematurely. The solution demonstrates how to correctly set the loop termination condition and highlights important considerations for creating efficient and reliable COBOL loops.
